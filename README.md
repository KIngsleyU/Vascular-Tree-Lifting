## Data

The VascuSynth dataset is located in the 'vascular_tree_data/' folder. 

Source: https://vascusynth.cs.sfu.ca/Data.html

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python3
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU

### Installation

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/lydiakim97/CMPT340-Vascular-Tree-Lifting.git
cd CMPT340-Vascular-Tree-Lifting
```

In order to install the required python packages run (in a new virtual environment):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training the Model

For training, execute the following command:

`python train.py`

Currently, the model is saved after every 10 epochs.


### Testing the Model

Ensure the EncoderPath and GeneratorPath to the saved model are correct. This will be used to load the trained model.

For testing the model, execute the following command:

`python test.py`


### Visualizing Results
3D visualizations are saved in the 'output/progress' directory. 

The MATLAB script, `createGif.m`, can be used to visualize progress of the model across epochs.
